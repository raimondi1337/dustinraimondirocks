				<h1>AGRIPPA</h1>
				<h3>(A Book of The Dead)</h3>
				<h3>by William Gibson</h3>
                <p><button onclick="happySound()" class="happy" id="ten">I hesitated</button><br>
				before untying the bow<br>
                that bound this book <button onclick="happySound()"  class="happy" id="sixteen">together</button>.</p>

				<p>A black book:<br>
				ALBUMS CA. AGRIPPA<br>
				Order Extra Leaves By Letter and Name</p>

				<p>A Kodak album of time-burned<br>
				black construction paper</p>

				<p>The string he tied<br>
                Has been unravelled by <button onclick="sadSound()" class="sad" id="one" >years</button><br>
				and the dry weather of trunks<br>
				Like a lady's shoestring from the First World War<br>
				Its metal ferrules eaten by oxygen<br>
				Until they resemble cigarette-ash</p>

				<p>Inside the cover he inscribed something in soft graphite<br>
				Now lost<br>
				Then his name<br>
				W.F. Gibson Jr.<br>
				and something, comma,<br>
				1924</p>

				<p>Then he glued his Kodak prints down</p>

				<p>And wrote under them<br>
				In chalk-like white pencil:<br>
				"Papa's saw mill, Aug. 1919."</p>

				<p>A flat-roofed shack<br>
				Against a mountain ridge<br>
				In the foreground are tumbled boards and offcuts<br>
				He must have smelled the pitch,<br>
				In August<br>
				The sweet hot reek<br>
				Of the electric saw<br>
				Biting into decades</p>

				<p>Next the spaniel Moko<br>
				"Moko 1919"<br>
				Poses on small bench or table<br>
				Before a backyard tree<br>
				His coat is lustrous<br>
				The grass needs cutting<br>
				Beyond the tree,<br>
				In eerie Kodak clarity,<br>
				Are the summer backstairs of Wheeling,<br>
				West Virginia<br>
				Someone's left a wooden stepladder out</p>

				<p>"Aunt Fran and [obscured]"<br>
				Although he isn't, this gent<br>
				He has a "G" belt-buckle<br>
				A lapel-device of Masonic origin<br>
				A patent propelling-pencil<br>
				A fountain-pen<br>
				And the flowers they pose behind so solidly<br>
				Are rooted in an upright length of whitewashed<br>
				concrete sewer-pipe.</p>

				<p>Daddy had a horse named Dixie<br>
				"Ford on Dixie 1917"<br>
				A saddle-blanket marked with a single star<br>
				Corduroy jodhpurs<br>
				A western saddle<br>
				And a cloth cap<br>
				Proud and happy<br>
                <button onclick="sadSound()" class="sad" id="nine">As any boy could be</button></p>

				<p>"Arthur and Ford fishing 1919"<br>
				Shot by an adult<br>
				(Witness the steady hand<br>
				that captures the wildflowers<br>
				the shadows on their broad straw hats<br>
				reflections of a split-rail fence)<br>
				standing opposite them,<br>
				on the far side of the pond,<br>
				amid the snake-doctors and the mud,<br>
				Kodak in hand,<br>
				Ford Sr.?</p>

				<p>And "Moma July, 1919"<br>
				strolls beside the pond,<br>
				in white big city shoes,<br>
				Purse tucked behind her,<br>
				While either Ford or Arthur, still straw-hatted,<br>
				approaches a canvas-topped touring car.</p>

				<p>"Moma and Mrs. Graham at fish hatchery 1919"<br>
				Moma and Mrs. G. sit atop a graceful concrete arch.</p>

				"Arthur on Dixie", likewise 1919,<br>
				rather ill at ease. On the roof behind the barn, behind him,<br>
				can be made out this cryptic mark:<br>
				H.V.J.M.[?]</p>

				<p>"Papa's mill 1919", my grandfather most regal amid a wrack of<br>
				cut lumber,<br>
				might as easily be the record<br>
				of some later demolition, and<br>
				His cotton sleeves are rolled<br>
				to but not past the elbow,<br>
				striped, with a white neckband<br>
				for the attachment of a collar.</p>

				<p>Behind him stands a cone of sawdust some thirty feet in height.<br>
				(How that feels to tumble down,<br>
				or smells when it is wet)</p>

				<h4>II.</h4>

            <p><button onclick="sadSound()" class="sad" id="five">The mechanism</button>: stamped black tin,<br>
				Leatherette over cardboard, bits of boxwood,<br>
				A lens<br>
				The shutter falls<br>
				Forever<br>
				Dividing that from this.</p>

				<p>Now in high-ceiling bedrooms,<br>
				unoccupied, unvisited,<br>
				in the bottom drawers of veneered bureaus<br>
				in cool chemical darkness curl commemorative<br>
				montages of the country's World War dead,</p>

				<p>just as I myself discovered<br>
				one other summer in an attic trunk,<br>
				and beneath that every boy's best treasure<br>
				of tarnished actual ammunition<br>
				real little bits of war<br>
				but also<br>
				the mechanism<br>
				itself.</p>

				<p>The blued finish of firearms<br>
				is a process, controlled, derived from common<br>
				rust, but there under so rare and uncommon a patina<br>
				that many years untouched<br>
				until I took it up<br>
				and turning, entranced, down the unpainted<br>
				stair, to the hallway where I swear<br>
				I never heard the first shot.</p>

				<p>The copper-jacketed slug recovered<br>
				from the bathroom's cardboard cylinder of<br>
				Morton's Salt was undeformed<br>
				save for the faint bright marks of lands<br>
				and grooves so hot, stilled energy,<br>
				it blistered my hand.</p>

				<p>The gun lay on the dusty carpet.<br>
				Returning in utter awe I took it so carefully up<br>
				That the second shot, equally unintended,<br>
				notched the hardwood bannister<br>
				and brought a strange bright smell of ancient sap to life<br>
				in a beam ofdusty sunlight.<br>
				Absolutely alone<br>
				in awareness of the mechanism.</p>

                <p>Like <button onclick="sadSound()" class="sad" id="seven">the first time</button> you put your mouth<br>
				on a woman.</p>

				<h4>III.</h4>

				<p>"Ice Gorge at Wheeling<br>
				1917"</p>

				<p>Iron bridge in the distance,<br>
				Beyond it a city.<br>
				Hotels where pimps went about their business<br>
				on the sidewalks of a lost world.<br>
				But the foreground is in focus,<br>
				this corner of carpenter's Gothic,<br>
				these backyards running down to the freeze.</p>

				<p>"Steamboat on Ohio River",<br>
				its smoke foul and dark,<br>
				its year unknown,<br>
				beyond it the far bank<br>
				overgrown with factories.</p>

				<p>"Our Wytheville<br>
				House Sept. 1921"</p>

				<p>They have moved down from Wheeling and my father wears his<br>
				city clothes. Main Street is unpaved and an electric streetlamp is<br>
				slung high in the frame, centered above the tracked dust on a<br>
				slack wire, suggesting the way it might pitch in a strong wind,<br>
				the shadows that might throw.</p>

				<p>The house is heavy, unattractive, sheathed in stucco, not native<br>
				to the region. My grandfather, who sold supplies to contractors,<br>
				was prone to modern materials, which he used with<br>
				wholesaler's enthusiasm. In 1921 he replaced the section of brick<br>
				sidewalk in front of his house with the broad smooth slab of poured<br>
				concrete, signing this improvement with a flourish, "W.F.<br>
				Gibson 1921". He believed in concrete and plywood<br>
                particularly. Seventy <button onclick="happySound()"  class="happy" id="eight">years later</button> his signature remains, the slab<br>
				floating perfectly level and charmless between mossy stretches of<br>
				sweet uneven brick that knew the iron shoes of Yankee horses.</p>

				<p>"Mama Jan. 1922" has come out to sweep the concrete with a<br>
				broom. Her boots are fastened with buttons requiring a special instrument.</p>

				<p>Ice gorge again, the Ohio, 1917. The mechanism closes. A<br>
				torn clipping offers a 1957 DeSOTO FIREDOME, 4-door Sedan,<br>
				torqueflite radio, heather and power steering and brakes, new<br>
				w.s.w. premium tires. One owner. $1,595.</p>

				<h4>IV.</h4>

                <p><button onclick="happySound()" class="happy" id="six">He made it</button> to the age of torqueflite radio<br>
				but not much past that, and never in that town.<br>
				That was mine to know, Main Street lined with<br>
				Rocket Eighty-eights,<br>
				the dimestore floored with wooden planks<br>
				pies under plastic in the Soda Shop,<br>
				and the mystery untold, the other thing,<br>
				sensed in the creaking of a sign after midnight<br>
				when nobody else was there.</p>

				<p>In the talc-fine dust beneath the platform of the<br>
				Norfolk & Western lay indian-head pennies undisturbed since<br>
				the dawn of man.</p>

				<p>In the banks and courthouse, a fossil time<br>
				prevailed, limestone centuries.</p>

				<p>When I went up to Toronto<br>
				in the draft, my Local Board was there on Main Street,<br>
				above a store that bought and sold pistols.</p>

				<p>I'd once traded that man a derringer for a<br>
				Walther P-38. The pistols were in the window<br>
				behind an amber roller-blind<br>
				like sunglasses. I was seventeen or so but basically I guess<br>
				you just had to be a white boy.<br>
				I'd hike out to a shale pit and run<br>
				ten dollars worth of 9mm<br>
				through it, so worn you hardly<br>
				had to pull the trigger.<br>
				Bored, tried shooting<br>
				down into a distant stream but<br>
				one of them came back at me<br>
				off a round of river rock<br>
				clipping walnut twigs from a branch<br>
				two feet above my head.</p>

                <p>So that <button onclick="sadSound()" class="sad" id="fifteen">I remembered</button> the mechanism.</p>

				<h4>V.</h4>

				<p>In the all night bus station<br>
				they sold scrambled eggs to state troopers<br>
				the long skinny clasp-knives called fruit knives<br>
				which were pearl handled watermelon-slicers<br>
				and hillbilly novelties in brown varnished wood<br>
				which were made in Japan.</p>

				<p>First I'd be sent there at night only<br>
				if Mom's carton of Camels ran out,<br>
				but gradually I came to value<br>
				the submarine light, the alien reek<br>
				of the long human haul, the strangers<br>
				straight down from Port Authority<br>
				headed for Nashville, Memphis, Miami.<br>
				Sometimes the Sheriff watched them get off<br>
				making sure they got back on.</p>

				<p>When the colored restroom<br>
				was no longer required<br>
				they knocked open the cinderblock<br>
				and extended the magazine rack<br>
				to new dimensions,<br>
				a cool fluorescent cave of dreams<br>
				smelling faintly and forever of disinfectant,<br>
				perhaps as well of the travelled fears<br>
				of those dark uncounted others who,<br>
				moving as though contours of hot iron,<br>
				were made thus to dance<br>
				or not to dance<br>
				as the law saw fit.</p>

				<p>There it was that I was marked out as a writer,<br>
				having discovered in that alcove<br>
				copies of certain magazines<br>
				esoteric and precious, and, yes,<br>
				I knew then, knew utterly,<br>
                <button onclick="sadSound()" class="sad" id="thirteen">the deal done in my heart forever</button>,<br>
				though how I knew not,<br>
				nor ever have.</p>

				<p>Walking home<br>
				through all the streets unmoving<br>
				so quiet I could hear the timers of the traffic lights a block away:<br>
				so quiet I could hear the timers of the traffic lights a block away:<br>
				the mechanism. Nobody else, just the silence<br>
				spreading out to where the long trucks groaned<br>
                on the highway their vast brute <button onclick="happySound()" class="happy" id="twelve">souls in want</button>.</p>


				<h4>VI.</h4>

				<p>There must have been a true last time<br>
				I saw the station but I don't remember<br>
                <button onclick="happySound()" class="happy" id="">I remember</button> the <button onclick="sadSound()" class="sad" id="three">stiff black</button> horsehide coat<br>
				gift in Tucson of a kid named Natkin<br>
                <button onclick="happySound()" class="happy" id="two">I remember</button> the cold<br>
                <button onclick="happySound()" class="happy" id="four">I remember</button> the Army duffle<br>
				that was lost and the black man in Buffalo<br>
				trying to sell me a fine diamond ring,<br>
				and in the coffee shop in Washington<br>
				I'd eavesdropped on a man wearing a black tie<br>
				embroidered with red roses<br>
				that I have looked for ever since.</p>

				<p>They must have asked me something<br>
				at the border<br>
                <button onclick="sadSound()" class="sad" id="eleven">I was admitted</button><br>
				somehow<br>
				and behind me swung the stamped tin shutter<br>
				across the very sky<br>
				and I went free<br>
				to find myself<br>
				mazed in Victorian brick<br>
				amid sweet tea with milk<br>
				and smoke from a cigarette called a Black Cat<br>
				and every unknown brand of chocolate<br>
				and girls with blunt-cut bangs<br>
				not even Americans<br>
				looking down from high narrow windows<br>
				on the melting snow<br>
				of the city undreamed<br>
				and on the revealed grace<br>
				of the mechanism,<br>
				no round trip.</p>

				<p>They tore down the bus station<br>
				there's chainlink there<br>
				no buses stop at all<br>
				and I'm walking through Chiyoda-ku<br>
				in a typhoon<br>
				the fine rain horizontal<br>
				umbrella everted in the storm's Pacific breath<br>
				tonight red lanterns are battered.</p>

				<p>laughing,<br>
				in the mechanism.</p>
